I got the idea from a comment referring to a blog post on Hacker news. Others would use it for creating new data science projects such as model creation and engineering. It is new because not only does it enforce project structure (like cookiecutter data science) but also allow for scaffolding of frameworks.

For instance lets say you want to integrate a core ml model
you would do the following
dk get resnet-coreml

And dk would create a file and output the code to integrate it in your app. Also the resnet coreml file would be put in the current working directory
Or lets say you want to do mnist with tensor flow

dk get data mnist
dk create project
